## Introduction

We present the fourth Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (4-OGC) of binary neutron star (BNS), binary black hole (BBH) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. The catalog includes observations from 2015-2020 covering the first through third observing runs (O1, O2, O3a, O3b) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The updated catalog includes 7 BBH mergers which were not previously reported with high significance during O3b for a total of 94 observations: 90 BBHs, 2 NSBHs, and 2 BNSs. The most confident new detection, GW200318\_191337, has component masses 49.1(+16.4-12.0) Msun and 31.6(+12.0-11.6) Msun; its redshift of $0.84^{+0.4}_{-0.35}$ (90\% credible interval) may make it the most distant merger so far. We provide reference parameter estimates for each of these sources using an up-to-date model accounting for instrumental calibration uncertainty. The corresponding data release also includes our full set of sub-threshold candidates.
